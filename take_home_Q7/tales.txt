1. NASRUDDIN GALLOPS THROUGH THE MARKET
The town square was crowded for market day.

Then, all of a sudden, Nasruddin came galloping through the square on his donkey. It looked like he was about to fall off, barely holding onto the reins with one hand while struggling to keep his turban on with the other.

Nobody had ever seen Nasruddin or his donkey move this fast!

“Hey there, Nasruddin!” yelled one of his friends as Nasruddin rode by. “Just where are you going in such a hurry?”

Nasruddin shouted a reply as the donkey galloped past. “I honestly don’t know! You need to ask the donkey!”

2. NASRUDDIN SHARES THE DONKEY’S LOAD
Nasruddin had gone into the forest to chop wood.

At day’s end, he bundled up the wood but, instead of putting the bundle on the donkey, he put the bundle on his own head. He then clambered up on the donkey and rode into town.

“Nasruddin!” shouted one of his friends. “Why are you carrying that bundle of wood there on your head? Doesn’t it hurt?”

“It does hurt,” Nasruddin admitted, “but I wanted to help share the load.”

“I still don’t understand,” said Nasruddin’s friend, looking puzzled.

“The donkey is carrying me,” explained Nasruddin, “but I’m carrying the wood.”
